Here’s your revised post, polished for clarity, grammar, and professionalism—with the update about the lightweight vs fat JAR situation included:

I'm trying to configure a custom Kafka exporter in my Zeebe broker using the following YAML:

```yaml
zeebe:
  broker:
    exporters:
      KafkaExporter:
        className: com.example.exporter.kafka.KafkaExporter
        jarPath: /usr/local/zeebe/exporters/zeebe-kafka-exporter.jar
```

However, I'm encountering the following exception during broker startup:

```
Caused by: io.camunda.zeebe.broker.exporter.repo.ExporterLoadException: Cannot load exporter [KafkaExporter]: cannot load specified class
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.example.exporter.kafka.KafkaExporter
```

I also tried renaming the exporter entry to a more generic name like `kafka`:

```yaml
zeebe:
  broker:
    exporters:
      kafka:
        className: com.example.exporter.kafka.KafkaExporter
        jarPath: /usr/local/zeebe/exporters/zeebe-kafka-exporter.jar
```

But I still get the same error:

```
Caused by: io.camunda.zeebe.broker.exporter.repo.ExporterLoadException: Cannot load exporter [kafka]: cannot load specified class
Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.example.exporter.kafka.KafkaExporter
```

Here's what I’ve observed:

✅ If I package the exporter as a **lightweight JAR** (without dependencies), it works fine.

❌ But when I build a **fat JAR** (including all dependencies), the Zeebe broker throws a `ClassCastException` for the exporter class.

### What I Need Help With:

* How can I correctly build a fat JAR for a Zeebe exporter with dependencies?
* Is there a known issue with class loading or shading in fat JARs for custom exporters?
* Can someone confirm what the `className` should be and how the exporter name in YAML is interpreted?

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Would you like me to give you a sample `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` to generate a correct fat JAR for this use case?
